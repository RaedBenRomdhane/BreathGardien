# BreathGardien

**BreathGardien** is a Python desktop application designed for **automated lung tumor segmentation from 3D CT scans**. Using deep learning models built with **PyTorch** and **MONAI**, it allows clinicians and researchers to **visualize CT data in both 2D and 3D**, predict segmentation masks, and overlay resultsâ€”all in an intuitive PyQt5-based GUI.

---

## Project Scope: Lung Tumor Segmentation

This application is focused on **segmenting lung tumors** in volumetric CT data. It leverages a trained neural network to predict tumor masks and provides both visual and interactive tools to inspect the results for clinical and research validation.

---

## Features

- Load 3D CT volumes stored in `.npy` format  
- Predict lung tumor segmentation masks using **PyTorch + MONAI**  
- View 2D axial slices (original, predicted, and overlay)  
- Render 3D CT volumes and predicted masks using VTK  
- Switch between 2D/3D views and control visualization  
- Dark-mode, responsive UI for comfortable review

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breathgardien.git
cd breathgardien
````

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Required)

Create the environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python GUI.py
```

---

## Data Format

The application expects CT volumes in `.npy` format with the following naming convention:

```
data-<patient_index>-<slice_index>.npy
```

### Example:

```
data-0-0.npy  
data-0-1.npy  
...
data-1-0.npy
...
```

These files are combined into a full 3D NumPy tensor of shape `[depth, height, width]`.

---

## Segmentation Process

The `predict()` function in `src/backend/predect.py` runs the lung tumor segmentation model.

The model used is **UNETR**, a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of U-Net and Transformer networks. It is built using MONAI and PyTorch and returns a binary mask.

Predictions can be visualized in 2D side-by-side with the original data, or in full 3D using VTK overlays.

You can check the code used to train the model and the dataset directly on Kaggle:
